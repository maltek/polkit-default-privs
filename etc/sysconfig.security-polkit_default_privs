## Type:        list(set,warn,no)
## Default:     set

#
# set_polkit_default_privs can check Polkit default privileges.
# Setting this variable to "set" will change privileges that don't match the
# default. Setting to "warn" only prints a warning and "no" will
# disable this feature.
#
# Defaults to "set" if not specified

## Type:        string
## Default:     "standard"
## Config:      set_polkit_default_privs
#
# SUSE ships with three sets of default privilege settings. These are as
# follows:
#
# - "restrictive": conservative settings that require the root user
# password for a lot of actions and disable certain actions completely for
# remote users. This should only be used on systems where security
# requirements are high and for experienced users. Usability can suffer a bit,
# especially on desktop systems, so custom tuning of polkit rules might become
# necessary.
#
# - "standard": balanced settings that restrict sensitive actions to require
# root authentication but allow less dangerous operations for regular logged
# in users. This should be used on server systems or multi-user systems.
#
# - "easy": settings that are focused on ease of use. This sacrifices security
# to some degree to allow a more seamless user experience without
# interruptions in the workflow due to password prompts. This should only be
# used for single-user desktop systems.
#
# Examples: "standard", "restrictive foo bar"
#
# If not set the value depends on the setting of
# PERMISSION_SECURITY. If PERMISSION_SECURITY contains 'secure' or
# 'paranoid' the value will be 'restrictive', otherwise 'standard'.
#
# The '/etc/polkit-default-privs.local' file is always evaluated and takes
# precedence over all other files.
